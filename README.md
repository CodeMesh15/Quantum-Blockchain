# Quantum-Blockchain
Goals for the Quantum Blockchain:
Quantum Key Generation and Signature:
Use Qiskit to create quantum keys for signing and validating transactions.
Consensus Algorithm:
Simulate the Stake-Vote with Borda Count to elect witness nodes.
Blockchain Data Structure:
Define a chain of blocks with quantum signatures and timestamped transactions.
Quantum Signature Validation:
Use quantum algorithms to validate transactions and ensure security.
