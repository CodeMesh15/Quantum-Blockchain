# Quantum-Blockchain
Goals for the Quantum Blockchain:
Quantum Key Generation and Signature:
Use Qiskit to create quantum keys for signing and validating transactions.
Consensus Algorithm:
Simulate the Stake-Vote with Borda Count to elect witness nodes.
Blockchain Data Structure:
Define a chain of blocks with quantum signatures and timestamped transactions.
Quantum Signature Validation:
Use quantum algorithms to validate transactions and ensure security.

To extend the quantum blockchain implementation with further quantum signature validation and additional integration, we will:

Enhance Signature Validation:

Introduce realistic verification by reconstructing the public key from the transaction and comparing quantum states.
Add Transaction Packaging and Validation:

Include a step for witness nodes to validate and package transactions into blocks.
Simulate More Blockchain Operations:

Expand the code to simulate multiple rounds of block generation and validation.
 I am thinking next to add further features like consensus visualization, detailed logging, or integration with more advanced quantum protocols.

 Since Rust does not have a native quantum computation framework, the example focuses on simulating the concepts such as quantum key distribution, voting, and basic blockchain mechanism I'm trying to merge the possiblity of deploying it over an upgraded solana environment , which could pave the way for blockchains being quantum resistant ledger , I'm a bit sceptical about this thought but gotta give this a shot
