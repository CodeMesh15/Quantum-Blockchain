### Quantum-Blockchain
- Goals for the Quantum Blockchain:
## Quantum Key Generation and Signature:
- Use Qiskit to create quantum keys for signing and validating transactions.
## Consensus Algorithm:
- Simulate the Stake-Vote with Borda Count to elect witness nodes.
## Blockchain Data Structure:
- Define a chain of blocks with quantum signatures and timestamped transactions.
## Quantum Signature Validation:
- Use quantum algorithms to validate transactions and ensure security.

# To extend the quantum blockchain implementation with further quantum signature validation and additional integration, we will:

- Enhance Signature Validation
- Introduce realistic verification by reconstructing the public key from the transaction and comparing quantum states
- Add Transaction Packaging and Validation
- Include a step for witness nodes to validate and package transactions into blocks.

## Simulate More Blockchain Operations:
- Expand the code to simulate multiple rounds of block generation and validation.
- I am thinking next to add further features like consensus visualization, detailed logging, or integration with more advanced quantum protocols.
