# Quantum-Blockchain
Goals for the Quantum Blockchain:
Quantum Key Generation and Signature:
Use Qiskit to create quantum keys for signing and validating transactions.
Consensus Algorithm:
Simulate the Stake-Vote with Borda Count to elect witness nodes.
Blockchain Data Structure:
Define a chain of blocks with quantum signatures and timestamped transactions.
Quantum Signature Validation:
Use quantum algorithms to validate transactions and ensure security.

To extend the quantum blockchain implementation with further quantum signature validation and additional integration, we will:

Enhance Signature Validation:

Introduce realistic verification by reconstructing the public key from the transaction and comparing quantum states.
Add Transaction Packaging and Validation:

Include a step for witness nodes to validate and package transactions into blocks.
Simulate More Blockchain Operations:

Expand the code to simulate multiple rounds of block generation and validation.
 I am thinking next to add further features like consensus visualization, detailed logging, or integration with more advanced quantum protocols.
